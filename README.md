# Cloudinary NodeJS Quickstart

This is the [quickstart project](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/javascript_quick_start) from the Cloudinary docs
using updated Parcel.

## Setup

0. Have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) installed on your PC.
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. (Optional) Replace the `cloudName` and the image Public ID on lines 7 and 15 of `index.js` respectively.
4. Run `npm start`.

## Troubleshooting

In case of cryptic errors from Parcel such as `Expected content key...`, delete `.parcel-cache` directory in the root of the
project and start again.
